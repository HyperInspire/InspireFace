## Tracker Optional

### Tracking by Landmark

Tracking by Landmark is a basic tracking mode with high speed but average accuracy. It is recommended to be used in the portrait mode of the front camera of the mobile phone, which is suitable for the case of tracking 1-5 faces.

### Tracking by Detection

Tracking by Detection has high accuracy but slow speed. Currently, only bytetrack is implemented. Source code is in [DeepSORT](https://github.com/shaoshengsong/DeepSORT/tree/master/tracker/bytetrack/).
