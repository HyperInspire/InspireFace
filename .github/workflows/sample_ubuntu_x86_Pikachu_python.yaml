# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed for a CMake project running on a single platform (Ubuntu-x86).
# For multi-platform testing, see the link provided.
# Refer to: https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/cmake-multi-platform.yml
name: Run Ubuntu-x86 Test Pikachu from Python Native

# Trigger this workflow on push or pull request to the "feature/sub" branch
on:
  push:
    branches: ["master"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["master"]

# Define environment variables shared across jobs
env:
  # Set the CMake build type (e.g., Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo, etc.)
  BUILD_TYPE: Release

# Jobs section defines all individual tasks for the CI workflow
jobs:
  build:
    # Specify that this job should run on the latest Ubuntu environment provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define steps for this job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code from the repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Update Git submodules recursively
      - name: Update submodules
        run: |
          git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/HyperInspire/3rdparty.git

      # Step 3: Install necessary dependencies for building the CMake project
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update  # Update package lists
          # Install build tools and required libraries for video processing
          sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libgtk-3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libjpeg-dev libswscale-dev

      # Step 4: Run a separate script for CMake configuration and building
      - name: Download Dataset And Configure CMake
        # Execute a pre-existing script to handle CMake configuration and building
        # The script is assumed to be located at `ci/quick_test_linux_x86_usual.sh`
        run: bash ci/quick_test_linux_x86_usual_python_native_interface.sh
